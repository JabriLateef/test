			<h2>My WHY</h2>
			<p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an 
				all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and 
				internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
				and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
			<blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
				I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>
